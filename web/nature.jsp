        <p>The building gets its name from The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the inspiration for its design. The exquisitely built Albert Hall is housed in the centre of Ram Niwas Garden. Sir Swinton Jacob (who is also the mastermind behind many other palaces in Rajasthan) conceptualised and designed it using styles from the Indo-Sarcenic architecture and the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone of the building in 1876. The museum displays a wide range of metal objects, wood crafts, carpets, stone and metal sculptures, arms and weapons, natural stones and ivory goods. It also houses a large collection of miniatures from Bundi, Kota, Kishangarh, Udaipur and Jaipur schools of art.

        <p>Amrapali Museum is an initiative by the founders of Amrapali Jewels Pvt. Ltd. The museum is dedicated to Indian jewellery and jewelled objects, located in the city of Jaipur. For the founders (Rajiv Arora and Rajesh Ajmera) the collection has been a labour of love that began nearly forty years ago when they became friends at college, and that continues to this day. The museum has several areas to focus over two floors. The ground floor displays items of beauty and adornment, silver and gold jewellery for every part of the body, from virtually every region of India; with a special focus on pieces that are connected with rites of passage, from birth to death. The basement houses numerous inspirations for designs that have been available to the Indian craftsman over time, seen through both the jewelry and the range of silver objects in the collection. A separate section is dedicated to heirloom textiles that are embellished with gold and silver. The entire collection is made up of over 4000 pieces, of which around 800 are on display. The rest can be seen in the Visual Storage. Unlike other museums, where thousands of exhibits remain out of sight for lack of space, Amrapali Museum brings you the Visual Store, housing the reserve collection. Visitors are welcome to explore the Visual Store cases in the museum. The Founders are keen to share their entire collection with the world, in the belief that the unknown creators of each piece would have wanted their work to be seen and admired. Because these creations are ageless, timeless and priceless. Visitors from foreign shores will be entranced by this fascinating testimony to India's craftsmanship. Jewellery for every part of the human form, jewelled artefacts from every corner of India, heirloom textiles embellished with gold and silver, and much more. Visitors can also shop handcrafted silver jewellery and objects similar to that of in the museum and also complete range of fine and silver jewellery from our Museum Shop.
